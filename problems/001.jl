Problem Description:
-------------------
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Example:
--------
Input: 10
Output: 23 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9)

Solution:
---------
We use the set of multiples of 3 and 5 to compute the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

This is given by the formula:

sum_3(n) U sum_5(n) = sum_3(n) + sum_5(n) - sum_3 âˆ© sum_5(n)
                    = sum_3(n) + sum_5(n) - sum_15(n)

Where sum_k(n) is the sum of all the multiples of k below n.

Because the multiples of 15 are multiples of 3 and 5, we need to subtract them once.
