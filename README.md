Worked out Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/

The code can either be run using Julia or Python.

## Julia
Download the latest version of Julia [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

If you want to run the Julia script from your terminal then CD to the location of the code and do:

`problems/002.jl`

In the shell of your choice.

If you want to run it from the Julia REPL then you want:

`julia> include("problems/002.jl")`

## Python
You can use any version of Python, there is probably one installed on your system already. 

If not, then you can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

CD to the location of the code in your terminal and run the script as follows:

`python problems\002.py`
